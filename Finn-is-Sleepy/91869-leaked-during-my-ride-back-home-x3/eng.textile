I went out to drink with some friends tonight, the cocktail I had was a bit big for my bladder size and we ended up staying and chatting much longer than I expected x3 (its 3am so by this time everything is closed already) which means I got pretty desperate, I rode my electric scooter back home but since the roads here are made of stone tiles it goes really hard on the bladder >~< I tried to press my legs together but some leaks went out and I felt super nervous when I felt it in my undies >w< the damage wasnt too bad tho! and im still wearing the undies because why not~ ill change them in the morning if they smell hahaha

I thought about it, but I was scared my dad would be waiting for me or something and would see me x3 I also washed my shoes today, don't want them smelling like pee already haha

Aww, the cobblestone can make it tough to hold 😕 but you did a pretty good job! Most of it stayed in! Gotta celebrate the small victories xD

True haha! Ended up sleeping in the undies cause they weren't too wet, they smelled really bad in the morning though xD

That is barely and accident. It would dry in like 10-15 minutes. Nice that you got a little taste of wetting without having to fully wet. 😁

Yeah! It was just a little pee but it was pretty nerve racking x3 feeling that warm spread in the undies haha
