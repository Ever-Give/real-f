I had a stressful day yesterday and I accidentally fell asleep at about 8:30 p.m. so I did not use the bathroom before hand I woke up at about 9 a.m with extremely full bladder a lot of pressure to the point that I was afraid if I moved it would squirt out. As I was gathering my thoughts a squirt shout out and I grabbed myself with both hands as I tried to sit up it just flooded out of me and I could not stop it.
