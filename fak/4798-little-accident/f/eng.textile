Today a little accident happened to me. I was putting together my new bed I bought yesterday and was really excited about it. I love constricting things and stuff so I was really not paying attention to anything else :). I was working hard and drinking a lot of water as it was kind of hot. I didn't think about peeing because I thought the water has gone into my sweat. after almost two hours I was trying to undo one mistake I have done and was pushing the screwdriver really hard. then suddenly the screw released and also has unexpectedly my bladder because I relaxed all my muscles in that moment. the pee just started to burst into my pants.

I dropped the screwdriver and tried to stop peeing by my hands and all the will. I managed to stop a little when I already had a huge wet spot on my pants and a bit on the floor. I stood up with hands in my crotch and went to bathroom. when I wanted to pull my hand out to take my pants down I just started to pee again with no hope to stop now so I just sit on the toilet in my pants and finished peeing.

Next time I am going to pay more attention to my physical needs even when I am working on something :D
