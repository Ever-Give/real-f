So! I decided to go to my area's largest hiking area, I love hiking but I also know my bladder is gonna be the biggest obstacle xD In the beginning, I walk by a people relatively often, so I cant just pee on a tree like I usually do...

Thankfully, I eventually pass by a river that is actually very easy to walk into! I was pretty hot and a little sweaty, so I decided to just walk in to refresh myself...and finally empty my bladder~ x3

The water was really cold even though I felt kinda hot x3 so you can probably tell how warm that felt hehe >w< my crotch really enjoyed the warm cloud~ After that, as you can imagine, I was kinda soaked x3 Not a huge problem since my layers dont take too long to dry, and im also wearing barefoot shoes, so no wet socks feeling :3 with that said though...being wet with cool water made my bladder work in overdrive >~<

Thankfully I went on a trail that had almost no one, but since I was already wet anyway, I decided to get fun with it and just stop, look back and fourth to make sure no one was coming...ahhh~ just let it go in my leggings and shorts x3 theres something insanely comforting and satisfying about being able to just stop and casually pee down my legs and feel a little warmth before going back to walking, its definitely an upgrade to the hiking experience!! Hehe~

After peeing more than a few times tho, my shoes were starting to get squishy from pee x3 my feet felt warm which was nice, but i didnt want my shoes to smell too bad so I decided to rinse them off in a little stream~

Cool water felt nice on my feet, but also made me need to pee x3 so I take the opportunity while im standing in the water to relieve myself...starts coming out....but then I see a biker coming at full speed down the trail >w< I cant really stop peeing so I turn away while im still peeing and thankfully hes going too fast to see anything xD was kinda spooky but at least im relieved and my feet are fresh~

I continue down the path towards the city, ocasionally stopping to warm up my underwear a little, at some point I even managed to let go while walking!! Im usually never able to do that hehe, so im kinda proud of myself~

Eventually though, i reach the city, which means no more peeing down my legs casually x3 at first I can hold it fine, but my bladder is kinda confused that ive been letting go without holding it the whole day and suddenly im asking it to hold up- so its not happy and i reaaally need to rush home....

The rest, is history ;3

That was great! Peeing underwater has its own level of kink.

I won't pee in a public pool, but if I'm by myself in a river or lake, it's fair game!

Rivers and lake are lifesavers x3 you can pee in nature without any shame~ And its really warm so, whats not to like!! ^w^
