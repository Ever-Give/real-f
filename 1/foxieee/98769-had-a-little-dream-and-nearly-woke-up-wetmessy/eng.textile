Hi!

Kinda a funny reason to post but i thought it was interesting and i also cant stop thiinking about it all day lol

So last night i had a dream with so many details and themes of this silly little desire i have i felt the need to share

It starts out in this weird shopping centre but also play park gym (idk dream locations are weird) I was wearing a t shirt and some shorts, like loose fit kinda pyjamas or casual style, not jeans.

And I was walking around with a friend then suddenly i needed to poop so i was looking for a bathroom but before long I felt myself going in my pants slowly, which is a feeling i love, especially with short pyjama bottoms or boxers kinda like this

&&

So I began to mess myself and was enjoying the feeling while walking but then i realised someone was behind me so i got super scared as i still needed to go real bad and wasn’t sure if they could see (or smell!) me so I tried to walk faster to get away from this man behind me

Then I somehow found a room with a potty in it, not a big toilet but like a little plastic potty and i distinctly remember trying to rip my pants off so that I could finish in the potty but it was too late, I started to go again and completely filled my shorts making the bulge even bigger.

By the time I got my pants off my mess was dropping all on the floor so I sat my little butt down on the potty and started to pee real hard, almost filling it up!

Then I woke up dazed and confuzzled and slowly came to my senses and realised I was on the verge of emptying my bladder and bowels in bed

So i quickly got up and hobbled/pottydanced to the bathroom (no accidents this time!!) and finished off on the big potty!

It was quite a weird experience, I’ve had lots of dreams where I mess myself but never had a potty involved or peeing in one!

Now I can’t stop thinking about relieving myself in a potty >.<

Anyway hope it was enjoyable! :3
