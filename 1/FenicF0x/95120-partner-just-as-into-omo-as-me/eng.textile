I’ve never posted here before so hope I’m not explaining things badly or writing weirdly

My partner and I have been together over a year and knew each other prior to that too, I’ve known since a couple months in that they also have a piss kink (though I’ve always hoped and I suspected quite a while before they told me) but I’ve never thought to post anything about it here. Now seems as good a time as ever.

I’ll probably post more in the future but might as well start with the most recent couple things to preface this; my partner has an insanely strong bladder, to the point it’s really difficult to get them properly desperate (I’m going to suggest the rapid desperation method next time but yet to find anything else that works), we both like holding but until recently it had been quite a while since my partner had been the one wetting, and we’re both in uni accommodation and it turns out these rooms have waterproof mattresses ( discovered after I leaked during a hold and panicked)

So we’d been talking about them doing a hold and I suggested they don’t pee again (it’s about 10pm) and see how long they can hold it into the next day, they agreed happily since it might finally allow them to get properly desperate which has only happened once (omorashi dungeon during summer, I’ll write about that another time).

Unfortunately we ended up having to go out the next day to do some last minute Halloween prep, meaning she didn’t actually drink much water until we got home around 6pm.

Despite both our best efforts to get plenty of water into her now that we were home it hit 10pm and while they did the to go it wasn’t anywhere near full desperation. However, due to us having classes the next day and the fact we’d still have to do washing and it was getting late we decided to just make the most of the fact they’d been holding for a full 24 hours and have them let go of what they did have built up

At this point we start making out given they’ve been holding so long and we’re both turned on from it, eventually I’m on my back with them lying on me and I ask them to try and let go for me. It doesn’t work, we spend more time waiting and trying different positions to see if that helps and it still isn’t. We kinda both start losing hope cause they’ve been trying to let go for almost an hour and it’s not getting anywhere but as a last ditch attempt I suggest they just sit there, without us making out, and focus on letting go.

So we’re sat there on the bed, with them straddling my lap and my lap starts to get warm, they finally managed to let go and it was perfect. The look of relief on her face was so gorgeous and while I knew watching her wet turned me on her soaking both us was so hot I couldn’t help squirming and thrusting towards her a little even though the angle meant I wasn’t actually rubbing against anything

We agreed we’ll definitely have to try this again with her a lot more desperate and I can’t wait
