Hey All! I've read a bunch about the "Rapid Desperation Challenge" (https://pastebin.com/z728Y2y3) and I figured I would give it a go. I'm planning to start around 7 tonight, so I'll be in preparation for a while. I'm planning on using this

- while doing the hold itself as to give me a fun challenge. I'll post updates here as I progress. I look forward to seeing you shortly!

Just an update! Drinking is going well, I feel the need to pee about every 15 minutes

*002*2018-03-19 19:54

Still drinking and peeing alot

Thats the plan. I'm going to keep drinking and peeing until about 7 at which point I will keep drinking but stop peeing and ill see how long I can last.

*016*2018-03-19 23:38

*018*2018-03-19 23:43

Im pinching down so hard on my shaft just to try and stay dry...

*020*2018-03-19 23:45

Yes. no peeing yet. but i have to try so hard

*021*2018-03-19 23:47

Ok......im really squirming

*022*2018-03-19 23:48

My bladder feels rock hard at this point

*023*2018-03-19 23:54

I can feel all the pressure bearing down on my urethra....not sure how much longer i can keep up without leaking

My whole body is trembling and its making typing really tough
